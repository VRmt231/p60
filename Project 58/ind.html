    FAVOURITE CHARACTER FROM FAVOURITE STORY: Bruno. 
    
    Character Analysis:
    <br>
    <br>
     
Bruno is a nine-year-old German boy and the novel’s protagonist. He misses the life and the friends he left behind in Berlin when his family unexpectedly moved to Poland for his father’s career. Although Bruno intuitively feels that his family’s new home at Out-With (Auschwitz) Camp is “the loneliest place in the world,” he does not understand what the place really is or what goes on there. He doesn’t comprehend why a massive fence stands so near to the family’s house, or why so many soldiers have been stationed there. Nor does he understand who the people on the other side of the fence are or why they are all wearing the same striped pajamas. Though Bruno eventually learns that the fence exists to separate a group of people known as “Jews” from people like him and his family, the lesson never fully makes sense to him. To the very end of the novel, when he tragically dies in a Nazi gas chamber, Bruno remains fundamentally ignorant of the real purpose of Out-With.

Despite remaining unaware of the historical and political context in which he lives, Bruno’s childlike innocence endows him with an important virtue that other characters in the novel lack. Namely, Bruno has the capacity to keep an open mind. The adults in the novel all have settled opinions about what’s occurring at Out-With and in Europe more broadly. Even Bruno’s sister, Gretel, graduates from playing with dolls to closely tracking Germany’s progress in the war and mindlessly echoing prejudices against Jews. By contrast, Bruno lacks preconceived notions about Germans, Jews, and any essential differences between them. It is precisely this lack of formal prejudice that allows Bruno to befriend Shmuel, the Jewish boy he meets one day while walking along the fence. Bruno’s friendship with Shmuel provides the main arc for the development of his character. When the two boys first meet, Bruno is self-centered and proves unable to really listen to what Shmuel says about his life and experience. With time, however, Bruno grows increasingly introspective, starts to notice his own selfish behaviors, and learns to see things through Shmuel’s eyes. Even as the novel moves toward its tragic conclusion, Bruno demonstrates a powerful sense of empathy with and responsibility for his friend.

    The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is an unusual story, one of the most difficult and disturbing a teen will ever read. It is the story of an event seared into the fabric of history. It is a fable told through the voice of a child, but it is not for children, and this is not just any child.

Bruno is nine years old, and he’s not happy; his father has a new job and he’s leaving his comfortable house, his neighborhood and his three best friends behind. His big sister Gretel is no help, for like older sisters everywhere, she’s in a world all her own, though it’s obvious she isn’t thrilled about the move either. Their servants are tight-lipped and nervous, and Bruno’s mother tries to explain that this is not only a promotion for his father, it’s his duty.

His father shows some but not much sympathy for Bruno. As befits a military man, he is a strict disciplinarian, and the boy tries his best to honor his father’s wishes, even though it sometimes involves saying and doing things he doesn’t understand. So Bruno says goodbye to his comfortable life and moves far away from the city. His destination isn’t a house in the country though at least not like any he’s ever imagined. It’s a bleak, forbidding place, and instead of a five-story mansion, he lives in a smaller, less comfortable house. He is surrounded by his father’s soldiers, including one particularly menacing lieutenant named Kotler, and there’s a cook who also appears to be a doctor, much to Bruno’s puzzlement. Strangest of all is the barbed-wire fence outside his bedroom window, and the huddled groups of men and boys beyond. Along that fence he’ll meet the boy of the book’s title.

If you haven’t already guessed, John Boyne’s The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a young adult novel about the Holocaust. By focusing on Bruno’s innocent and puzzled view of his father’s job, Boyne offers a previously unseen perspective on the everyday Germans who took part in the Nazis’ ultimate solution. While written with teens in mind, this is certainly a book worthy of adult readers. Already a bestseller in the U.K. and Australia, the novel is well written, compelling and ultimately shocking. It should be noted, however, that the book has garnered criticism from some who argue that the boy’s viewpoint trivializes this tragic era. Bruno is definitely naive by today’s standards, but this novel isn’t set in 2006—it takes place in 1943, when a sheltered child might well have been unaware of Auschwitz and the fate of the Jews who were sent there. Ultimately, it is up to the individual reader to judge whether Boyne’s unique approach to the Holocaust adds to the understanding of this troubling time in human history.
